# Homepage

A personal browser homepage for fast bookmark access across browsers with instant search.

![Homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hsiii/homepage/main/docs/demo.webp)

## Use

- Set your browser homepage as <https://homepage.hsichen.dev>.
- Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to start searching, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to
  open.
- Sign in to upload a wallpaper; guests keep the default mountain scene.
- Click the location control to sync the nearest Taiwan weather and AQI station.

## Privacy

Core features work without an account. Location is requested only after clicking the
location control. The selected Taiwan location is stored in a same-site cookie for
SSR and mirrored in browser storage with weather/AQI caches. Wallpaper sync requires
sign-in and uses Clerk, Neon, and Vercel Blob.

## Development

### Quick Start

Requires Node.js 22+ and Bun.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hsiii/homepage.git
cd homepage
bun i
bun dev
```

### Oracle Deployment

Production runs on the Oracle VM behind Caddy. The app is built with Next.js
standalone output and served from the Docker image in this repo.

The Oracle deployment repo expects this checkout at:

```

The container listens on `0.0.0.0:3102` and exposes `/api/health` for Compose
